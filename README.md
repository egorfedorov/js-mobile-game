# Javascript and HTML5 memory game for mobile device

This a memory game I'm building using jQuery Mobile. Players are presented with icons with a unique letter or number on them.
The icons are randomly placed on the screen, and after a short duration the the letters/numbers disappear from the icons and
the player must click the icons in alphabetical or numerical order to advance to the next level. Each level increases the number
of icons that the player must order (or level can be set to repeat), and more time is given per level (which is adjustable). Can
also be numbers only, alphabet only, alternating, or random.
